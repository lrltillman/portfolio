# Portfolio Project

## Goals of project

As a student, I want prospective employers to see an ongoing showcase of my work as I learn coding. I want to create an aesthetically pleasing and accessable site that includes information about myself, my background, and my repository. I want the site to have working links, clear sections, and I want it to be adaptable to the size of a screen. 

## Tools Used

To create this intial deployment of my portfolio, I used HTML and CSS. In HTML, I utilized both semantic and non-semantic tags. In CSS, I utilized flexbox and media queuries.
